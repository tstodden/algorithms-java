# Algorithms
This repository contains the implementations outlined by Sedgewick, Robert and Wayne, Kevin,
*Algorithms 4th Edition*. It is being used primarily as a tool for my better understanding 
the implementations. 

Additionally, it provides an environment for exploring the use of Bazel as a build tool for 
a Java project.
